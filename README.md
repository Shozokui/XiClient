Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, you can help in the following ways:

1) Cleaning: Rewrite functions to remove goto labels, remove unneeded local variables, clear clutter
2) Researching: Throughout the project there are methods and variables that have generic names (DoSomething, field_20, etc). Figure out their purpose and rename them
3) Commenting: Add clear comments to functions or class members explaining their purpose
4) Implementing: If you believe you know how something in the client works, you can implement that system
5) Auditing: Check existing code for inaccuracies and bugs
